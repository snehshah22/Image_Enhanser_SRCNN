# Image_Enhanser_SRCNN
Super Resolution Convolution Neural Network (SRCNN) is used in this project to improve image resolution. 

SRCNN is a deep convolutional neural network that learns end-to-end mapping of low resolution to high resolution images. Its used to improve the image quality of low resolution images. To evaluate the performance of this network, we will be using three image quality metrics: peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), mean squared error (MSE), and the structural similarity (SSIM) index.

12% improvement in structural similarity and 3.3% increment in Peak signal-to-noise ratio from output images v/s original reference images as compared to degraded images v/s original images.
